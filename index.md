## Blue Team Walkthroughs

In this blog, I aim to work through various Blue Team exercises such as malware traffic analysis and threat hunting CTFs. My goal is not only to walk you through the solutions, but to do so in a way that explains the building blocks of things like threat hunting or forensics in detail. 


### Questions? I (probably) have answers.

If you feel anything is wrong, poorly explained, or you have a question on a topic that isn't covered (yet), send me an email at jpardue@protonmail.com or reach out on twitter at @jacob_pardue. I'm new to twitter and still learning but I'll do my best.

### But First!!

While I do try to explain things in a way that assumes little to no prior experience, it is definitely helpful to at least have your feet wet with some context. Here are some great workshops that will be sufficient to get you the base knowledge to go through these walkthroughs much more easily.
